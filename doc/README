The documentation in this directory describes the whole tcng
system, and replaces the documents tcc/LANGUAGE, tcc/README,
tcsim/README, and doc/external.tex

Currently, only the Postscript output (tcng.ps) is correct. There
are still some bugs in t2x.pl, leading to formatting problems in
the plain text version (tcng.txt)

Just running "make" generates both, the Postscript and plain text
versions. "make tcng.pdf" also generates a PDF version from the
Postscript file.

README.tccext is and old description of the design of the external
interface, and only kept temporarily as a development reference.
