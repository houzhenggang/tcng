  "Bytes per second"
- new option -V to print version number

Version 0s (30-JAN-2001)
------------------------

- wrote README
- removed files SYNTAX and in* from the distribution and wrote LANGUAGE and
  examples/* instead
- added size qualifiers .b, .ns, and .nl for tcsim compatibility
- added dummy code for fw and route classifiers (so tcc doesn't just crash)
- tcc crashed when specifying a filter priority
- added "Byte" alias for "B"
- removed "ps" alias for "p"
- warning for "milli" prefix is now only printed once
- data_convert refused to convert from unum to fnum

Version 0r (28-JAN-2001)
------------------------

- added option -h to print usage
- tcc refused to pass cpp options to cpp
  (Note: it still complains about them, which is a bug)
- oops, usage() didn't exit()
- tcng.l would crash when issuing a syntax error or warning if receiving input
  without file names (i.e. not from cpp)
- qdisc ID assignment didn't recurse past next qdisc
- fixed arguments ordering bugs in tc.c, affecting qdiscs and filter elements

Version 0q (26-JAN-2001)

- added option -r to remove old qdiscs
- removed "dev" keyword and updated example in5 accordingly

Version 0p (26-JAN-2001)
------------------------

- if filters are now added to the closest class instead of always adding them
  to the qdisc; this can be changed by specifying an anchor with
  if filter $anchor <expression>
- "if" filter can be explicitly assigned to a variable to serve as an anchor 
  (not that if cannot be used as a regular filter, though)
- added a bit of dumping code to if filter and cbq qdisc to faciliate debugging
  of if anchoring
- added class id assignment and verification
- filter parameters were lost in some previous version

Version 0p (26-JAN-2001)

- switched over to new abstract operator handling
- added logical (&&, ||, !) and relational (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) operators to
  expression syntax
- added Perl-style postfix if, and pseudo-filter "if"
- added syntax for packet data access (base[index].size; one of base or index
  may be omitted, so may the integer literal size (default: 32))
- now recognizes also numbers like 1e6 (no dot) as a floating-point
- data_add_unit confused unum and fnum, usually yielding 0

Version 0o (25-JAN-2001)
------------------------

- unrecognized parameters are now reported immediately after parsing them
- added parameter checking for policing
- changed mask operator syntax from "a / b : c" to "a : b : c", i.e.
  a/b -> a:b, a/:c -> a::c, a/b:c -> a:b:c
- updated example in3 accordingly
- added / (division) operator
- added time data type dt_time with unit s(ecs?)?

- updated in3 example to use valid qdisc ID
- tcc now fails with an error if trying to nest selectors (used to produce
  garbage)
- added two more output wrappers: tc_add_unum and tc_add_hex
- added qdisc ... shortcut for class { qdisc ... }
- added output function tc_comment to print centered comments
- changed grammar to allow variable assignments to use syntax $var = ...
  This allows reserved names (b, B, rate, etc.) to be used as variable names.
  Had to disallow bare "class" (which isn't useful anyway)
- current example input set is in in5

Version 0m (24-JAN-2001)

------------------------

- dsmark sets class with "tc class change", not "tc class add"
- added data type dt_psize (size in packets)
- tentatively added data type dt_prate (rate in packets per second) with
  unit name "pps"
- don't add prio classes with tc
- fixed small memory leak when creating variables
- added command-line option -i to set default device

  run make dist, if necessary)
